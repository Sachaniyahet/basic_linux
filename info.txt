### **Key Features of Linux**  
1. **Open-Source** – The source code is freely available for modification and distribution.  
2. **Multi-User** – Multiple users can use the system simultaneously.  
3. **Multi-Tasking** – It can run multiple processes at the same time.  
4. **Security** – Built-in user permissions and security features.  
5. **Portability** – Runs on various hardware architectures.  
6. **Shell & Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – Provides powerful control over the system.

### **Basic Components of Linux**  
1. **Kernel** – The core of the OS that manages hardware and system processes.  
2. **Shell** – The command-line interface (CLI) that interprets user commands.  
3. **File System** – Organizes files in a hierarchical structure.  
4. **Processes** – Programs running in the system.  
5. **Users & Permissions** – Access control and security through user roles.

### **File System Structure**  
Linux uses a hierarchical file system with `/` (root directory) at the top:  
- `/home` – User files  
- `/etc` – Configuration files  
- `/bin` – Essential system commands  
- `/var` – Logs and temporary data  
- `/usr` – Installed software  
- `/dev` – Device files  
- `/proc` – Process information

### **Basic Linux Commands**  
📂 **File & Directory Management**  
- `ls` – List files  
- `cd` – Change directory  
- `pwd` – Show current path  
- `mkdir` – Create a directory  
- `rm` – Remove files or directories  

🔑 **User & Permissions**  
- `whoami` – Show current user  
- `chmod` – Change file permissions  
- `chown` – Change file ownership  

⚙️ **Process Management**  
- `ps` – View running processes  
- `kill` – Terminate a process  
- `top` – Monitor system resources  

🌐 **Networking**  
- `ping` – Check network connectivity  
- `ifconfig/ip` – View network settings  
- `wget/curl` – Download files  

🛠 **System Management**  
- `shutdown -h now` – Shutdown system  
- `reboot` – Restart system  
- `df -h` – Check disk space

### **Package Management**  
- **Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian)** → `apt-get`, `dpkg`  
- **RedHat-based (Fedora, CentOS)** → `yum`, `dnf`  
- **Universal** → `snap`, `flatpak`
